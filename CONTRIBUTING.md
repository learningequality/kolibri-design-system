## How can I contribute?

1. 💻 **Follow the [Getting started](./dev_docs/01_getting_started.md) to set up your development server.** At the bottom of the page, you can also find links that will take you to guidelines for the most common tasks.
2. 🔍 **Search for issues tagged as [help wanted](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri-design-system/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+no%3Aassignee+) or [good first issue](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri-design-system/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+no%3Aassignee).**
4. 🗣️ **Ask us for an assignment in the comments of an issue you've chosen.** Please request assignment of a reasonable amount of issues at a time. Once you finish your current issue or two, you are welcome to ask for more.
