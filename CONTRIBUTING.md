# How can I contribute?

1. 💻 Follow the [Getting started](./dev_docs/01_getting_started.md) to set up your development server. At the bottom of that page, you will also find links that will take you to guidelines for the most common tasks.
2. 🔍 Search for issues tagged as [help wanted](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri-design-system/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+no%3Aassignee+) or [good first issue](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri-design-system/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+no%3Aassignee).
3. 🗣️ Ask us for an assignment in the comments of an issue you've chosen.
